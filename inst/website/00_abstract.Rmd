# English abstract {-}

This report publishes the most recent analyses based on the census work carried out for the project "Algemene Broedvogelmonitoring Vlaanderen" or ABV for short.
This project is a joint initiative of the Instituut voor Natuur- en Bosonderzoek (INBO) and Natuurpunt Studie in cooperation with the local bird working groups.
The cooperation between these organisations guarantees a good support of and communication to the volunteer network by Natuurpunt Studie, and solid professional scientific support and data processing by INBO.

The project was started in 2007 and aims at describing the number trends of a set of ca. 80 general breeding bird species in Flanders.
Both annual fluctuations and multi-annual trends are interesting results in function of local, regional and international policy.

This report is meant as a technical background report.
It consists of three parts:
the first part describes the methodology of processing and presenting the results;
the second part presents a number of indicators based on trends of several types;
the third part describes the time series of individual species.
In parts two and three, we limit ourselves to a dry, standardised representation of the figures without an ecological interpretation.
For an ecological interpretation of the results we refer to other publications such as INBO Vogelnieuws.
